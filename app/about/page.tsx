          Hi! I&apos;m an incoming third-year student at the National University of
          Singapore, and I have a deep passion for endurance sports â€” especially
          running, cycling, and swimming. I love being outdoors and rarely stay
          still when I travel. Whether I&apos;m exploring a city or hiking up a
          mountain, I&apos;m always chasing a little adventure. In recent years, I&apos;ve
          really grown to love travel. Southeast Asia has been my playground,
          with unforgettable experiences in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. I
          find joy in discovering hidden trails, scenic peaks, and the stories
          each place holds.
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer, I&apos;ll be heading to Hong Kong for an internship with
          Expando World Limited, and shortly after, I&apos;ll begin my semester
          exchange in Vancouver at Simon Fraser University. I&apos;m incredibly
          excited to meet new people, immerse myself in different cultures, and
          keep exploring new places.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog is where I&apos;ll be sharing some of my favorite memories and
          stories from my travels! :D
